## Note: Donetsk is in beta, the experience may not be exactly what you expected. Bugs and issues are to be expected

# What is project Donetsk?
Project Donetsk is an attempt to create a more open Modern Warfare 2019 with a server browser, GSC, and a modder friendly environment

# What are some of the goals of project Donetsk
1. Allow Call of Duty Warzone to be played after Activision officially discontinued it on September 21st, 2023
2. Allow Modern Warfare to be played outside of Battle.net and Steam
3. Allow custom content such as maps, weapons, and cosmetics to be used in Modern Warfare
4. Add a server browser

2. Download the latest dll for Donetsk or compile from source
3. Put the dll into the game folder and launch "game_dx12_ship_replay.exe"
